# Map Challenge: Police Shootings

This folder contains your submission for the [map challenge](http://info343-joelross.rhcloud.com/challenges/map). The below questions should be answered with details about your submission!

##### 1. What information does your visualization show? What 'argument' are you making? #####
It shows the numbers of armed and unarmed victims of police shootings along with summaries of the events. Unarmed victims show in a more noticible, darker color to bring attention to the situations that most likely could have been handled in a less violent manner.

##### 2. Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what? #####
n/a

##### 3. Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who. #####
I collaborated a couple of times on this project with Halle Friedman, Quinn Mau and Casey Lee.

##### 4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge? #####
~12 hr

##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better? #####
I think this challenge needs more explanation on how to associate information between the HTML and JS files.
