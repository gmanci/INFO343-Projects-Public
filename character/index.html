        <h1>Who is Tobias Funke?</h1>
        <img src= "img/tobias.png" alt="Tobias">
            <p>Tobias is a loving father and husband as well as an aspiring actor on the hit Netflix series Arrested Development. A strange and overall oblivious man, Tobias entertains himself with a number of hobbies and attempted lines of work. Throughout his time on the show, Tobias creates a Doubtfire-esque alter ego named Mrs. Featherbottom, becomes a back-up performer for the Blue Man Group, writes a misleading self-reflection novel titled The Man Inside Me, and finds himself in a number of other awkward situations. Though he is not one of the main characters in the show, Tobias serves an integral role in aggravating and complicating the life of Arrested Development's main character, Michael Bluth.</p>
